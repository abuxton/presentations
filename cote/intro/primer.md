# Who am I? 
One of Puppet Labs London based Professional Service Engineers, coming from a background in the London start up community with a heavy leaning towards a the devops culture. The need to support my coffee addiction has taken me around the world working with and supporting all manner of development teams. The same addiction supported me through long nights of fire fighting and launch management for various game titles within EA, before I joined Puppet Labs. Feel free to buy me a coffee.
