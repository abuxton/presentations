# Introductions First!

From a background in scratching around in the guts of disparate and deprecated systems both technological and physical. A former lots of things, project manager, system administrator, university technician, Product Owner, consultant and chef! (The food type).

A need to support my coffee addiction has taken me around the world working with and supporting all manner of development teams. The same addiction has supported me through long days and nights of platform integrations, fire fighting and launch management for various development teams in startups, gaming, finance and most fields of enterprise.

Feel free to buy me a coffee and ask my opinion on anything technology, DevOps, or system architecture and  configuration management.
