# Introductions

A need to support my coffee addiction has taken me around the world working with and supporting all manner of development teams. The same addiction has supported me through long days and nights of platform integrations, fire fighting and launch management for various development teams in startups, gaming, finance and most fields of enterprise.

Feel free to buy me a coffee and ask my opinion on anything tech based, DevOps, or Comic book and Climbing.
