# Complimentary not Competative

Discussion on using DevOps tools in a complimentary manner.

Discussing the usage of different tools that have competing usage in certain areas of a DevOps platform in a complimentary way with ideas on best practices and considerations.

A discussion on not letting your self get embroiled in OS wars, language disputes and vendor promoted competative values.

Rather working as a DevOps community to compliment your workflow, needs and requirements with which ever tools you choose.
