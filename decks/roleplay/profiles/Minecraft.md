## Stay with me, honest... ##

You've either played or you have not. But every thing in Minecraft is layers of buildings blocks in collections. Your mountain is made up of dozens of layered blocks, recognisable as a mountain and not always the same core materials as the next one.

Your Crafting Table is the same components as mine. Sorry I said Crafting Table, I meant Jenkins server!
